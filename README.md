# Decentralized Online Personalized Learning [Privacy by design]

## High Level Control Parameters
1. Connectivity Graph of Neighbours 
2. Lookback interval
3. Lookahead period

## Storage Requirements 
1. Oracle 
2. Deep learning Model
3. Data buffer

## Features
1. Personalized Deep Learning Models with Identical Structure
2. Privacy by design since no node is aware of other's data.
3. Only model weights are exchange
4. Absence of a global model
5. Support Peer to Peer/Group Deep Learning

## Forecasting Experiments on Thailand's Smart Building Dataset
1. Isolated Learning (baseline model) vs Collective Learning with Neighbours
2. Effect of Network Topology on Learning 
3. Preferential Learning amongst Partners
